# It installs the signed, notarised macOS universal binary (or the static Linux binary)
# from mysetup.ai. There is deliberately no `service` block: background operation is
# opt-in through `mysetup service enable`, which registers the version-independent
# opt/ path, so `brew services` and our agent never both start a host.

      Get started:

        mysetup onboard

      Sign in, choose your skills and connect another computer.
      Setup turns on background sync after your skills are ready, where supported.
      Nothing is published.

      After upgrading:      mysetup status (updates the background engine safely)
      Before uninstalling:  mysetup self uninstall
                            (your skills are never removed)

      All commands: mysetup help
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/mysetup --version")
    assert_match "\"ok\":true", shell_output("#{bin}/mysetup doctor --offline --json")
    assert_match "\"installed\":false", shell_output("#{bin}/mysetup service status --json")
  end
end
